# TheoryOfComputation

This repository is part of my learning journey in **Theory of Computation (TOC)**.  
I am uploading my **codes and notes** on automata, formal languages, grammars, Turing machines, and complexity theory as I study and practice the subject.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Finite Automata (DFA, NFA, ε-NFA)  
- Regular Expressions & Regular Languages  
- Context-Free Grammars (CFG)  
- Pushdown Automata (PDA)  
- Turing Machines & Computability  
- Decidability & Undecidability  
- Complexity Theory (P, NP, NP-Complete, NP-Hard)
