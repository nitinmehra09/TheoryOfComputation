# TheoryOfComputation

**About**  
This repository is part of my learning journey in **Theory of Computation (TOC)**. I’m uploading only my **codes and notes** as I study automata, formal languages, grammars, Turing machines, and complexity theory.

## Topics Covered
- Finite Automata (DFA, NFA, ε-NFA)
- Regular Expressions & Regular Languages
- Context-Free Grammars (CFG)
- Pushdown Automata (PDA)
- Turing Machines & Computability
- Decidability & Undecidability
- Basics of Complexity (P, NP, NP-Complete, NP-Hard)

## Repository Structure
    TheoryOfComputation/
    ├─ Codes/   # Programs for each concept
    ├─ Notes/   # Short notes, proofs, examples
    └─ read-me.md

## How to Use
    # clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/TheoryOfComputation.git
    cd TheoryOfComputation

    # explore
    # open Codes/ for programs and Notes/ for markdown/pdf notes

## Goals (Work in Progress)
- Add more DFA/NFA examples
- Convert notes to concise checklists
- Add sample questions with solutions
- Include references to standard textbooks (only summaries/notes)

## Contribution
This is a personal learning repo. Suggestions are welcome through **issues** or **pull requests**; I’ll review when I can.
